# Habit Tracking project
This script allows you to track your habits or  activities by interfacing with the Pixela API. You can create, update, and delete records of your habits. Here I use cycling as my habit and find cycling  distance.

Features
-Create User: Registers a new user on Pixela.
-Create Graph: Creates a new graph to track cycling activities.
-Add Pixel: Adds a record of your cycling distance for the current day.
-Update Pixel: Updates the recorded cycling distance for the current day.
-Delete Pixel: Deletes the recorded cycling distance for the current day.
